hi, i'm bella.

this is my personal github where i keep projects, tools, and experiments.  
most of my work is practical, game-related, or built to solve very specific problems.

### video

**option A (best effort, stays in repo root):**  
this may embed as a player depending on github, otherwise it will open normally.

**option B (guaranteed inline player):**  
edit this README, drag the mp4 into the editor, and paste the generated link here:

## status

this is a temporary homepage.  
a proper site will replace this later.

thanks for stopping by :)
