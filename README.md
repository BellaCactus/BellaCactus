hi, i'm bella.

this is my personal github where i keep projects, tools, and experiments.
most of my stuff is practical, game-related, or built to solve very specific problems.

## projects

things you’ll mostly find here:

- network / limiter tools
- overlays & utilities
- small automation scripts
- random experiments and one-off ideas

## vibe / focus

- useful > perfect
- small tools that do exactly one job
- game-adjacent qol stuff
- learning-by-building

## status

this is a temporary homepage.
a proper site will replace this later.

thanks for stopping by :)
